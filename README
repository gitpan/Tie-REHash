Tie-REHash version 1.00
============================

Tie::REHash is a tie()d implementation of hybrid hash that allows using regexp "keys" along with plain keys (plus more).

INSTALLATION

With Perl 5.10 and later or if Module::Build module is installed, the preferred way to install is (commands issued in unpacked distribution directory):

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

On Windows this variant may work better:

	perl Build.PL
	Build
	Build test
	Build install

With perl 5.8 and older, if Module::Build is not installed:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

DEPENDENCIES

Tie::REHash is a pure Perl module that has no dependencies other then standard modules (perl 5.005 and later).
