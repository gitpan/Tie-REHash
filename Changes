Revision history for Perl extension Tie::REHash.

0.01  2007
	- original prototype (Big Bang) version. It was created for and long time battle tested as part of various applications. The general idea and hash interface were similar. It had test suit and documentation.

1.00  6 December 2010
	- first version released to CPAN. It is the complete redesign of both hash interface and implementation, as well as tests and documentation rewrite. 

1.01  7 December 2010
	- the "next-day" version. No change in API. Performance tunning. Minimum perl version is now corrected - it is (and was) 5.6. Minor corrections/improvements in documentation. Installation instructions in README now go all the way, up to source editing :) 

1.02  8 December 2010
	- the yet another "next-day" version. Again, no change in API. Working around perl bugs that cause installation problems revealed by cpantesters on perl 5.10.1 and pre-5.8.3 perls. Documentation update (in particular, BUGS section). 

1.03  17 December 2010
	- No changes except minor edits of perl bug warnings. Contrary to the information of rt.perl.org ticket 79178, it was discovered (from cpantesters reports for 1.02) that this perl bug is not confined to specified perl (core) versions range and even not strictly related to perl version - it may or may not affect different builds of same version of perl (probably it is up to differences in perl build options).
